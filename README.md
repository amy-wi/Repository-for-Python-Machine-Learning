# Repository-for-Python-Machine-Learning

In the attached project, I aimed to create a supervised classifier to predict puffin species from an input of various body dimensions. I have attached the workflow as a HTML, a Python file, and a Python Notebook file, the HTML being the most readable/accessible. Additionally, the raw data is uploaded as CSV file. I created and edited the Python Notebook file using Jupyter Notebook accessed through Anaconda Navigator.
